All potions have some color that written down as RGB color from <code>[0, 0, 0]</code> to <code>[255, 255, 255]</code>. To make task more complicated teacher will do few mixing and after will ask you for final color. Besides color you also need to figure out what volume will have potion after final mix.</p><h2 id="task">Task</h2><p>Based on your programming background you managed to figure that after mixing two potions colors will mix as if mix two RGB colors. For example, if you'll mix potion that have color <code>[255, 255, 0]</code> and volume <code>10</code> with one that have color <code>[0, 254, 0]</code> and volume <code>5</code>, you'll get new potion with color <code>[170, 255, 0]</code> and volume <code>15</code>. So you decided to create a class <code>Potion</code> that will have two properties: <code>color</code> (a list (a tuple in Python) with 3 integers) and <code>volume</code> (a number), and one method <code>mix</code> that will accept another <code>Potion</code> and return a mixed <code>Potion</code>.</p><h2 id="example">Example</h2><pre><code>felix_felicis       =  Potion([255, 255, 255],  7)shrinking_solution  =  Potion([ 51, 102,  51], 12)new_potion          =  felix_felicis.mix(shrinking_solution)new_potion.color   ==  [127, 159, 127]new_potion.volume  ==  19</code></pre><p><strong>Note</strong>: Use ceiling when calculating the resulting potion's color.</p>
